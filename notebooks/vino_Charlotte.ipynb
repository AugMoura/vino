       "546      Crisp green apple is the star in this well-made, balanced and elegant wine, that's tangy yet smooth, with a voluptuous tease of anise. Approachably structured, the complexity of the texture and lurking layers of further flavor suggest letting thi...\n",
       "548      This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper un...\n",

       "1091     From a three-acre spot known to get a hearty dose of fog, this wine speaks to cool-climate character, unveiling crisp floral layers of dried sage and white pepper from the get-go. Those aspects are joined by rose, lavender and cranberry-rhubarb o...\n",
       "1282                        Stunning aromatically, with a veil of smoke and petrol that lingers over fresh, clean Honeycrisp apple aromas. Semidry in style, with a simple, slightly sugary attack, it finishes with just a tinge of green pepper in the backdrop.\n",
       "4862     Made in a thick, oaky style, this shows burned caramel, fudge and hints of dried mint and oregano on the nose. The palate is rich with blueberry and dark chocolate, wrapped in a veil of oak smoke, with chunky, chewy tannins and a purple-flower nu...\n",

       "6620     This feminine Prosecco Superiore offers bright floral notes of jasmine and honeysuckle followed by peach and melon. The style is extra dry, meaning there is a veil of sweetness at the back, that is enhanced by the soft sparkling foam. This wine i...\n",
       "7475          Oaky and robust, this wine takes on a confectionery route to tropical flavor and high-octane concentration, offering a thickness of texture and body. Stainless-steel fermented, it unveils secondary flavors of lime and white peach on the finish.\n",
       "7704     At first the aromas of hard cheese and blatant oak veil the black fruit quotient in this blend. However, in the mouth the wine is more expressive and ripe, with plum, berry and ample oak-driven vanilla. It doesn't appear to have much depth or com...\n",
       "8876     Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard behind the winery in the western shade of Oakville, this wine opens with charred oak and a smoky, meaty character that intrigues. Seamless on the palate in soft, perceptible tannin, it delves into...\n",

       "10780       Whiffs of smoke and crushed stone form a veil over concentrated peach and preserved quince in this remarkably nuanced auslese. It's sweet and juicy on the palate and accented with hints of fresh herb. Earthy flavors lend a dark, savory dimension.\n",
       "11214                         Medium-strength, this wine opens with a bouquet of black cherry and raspberry, unveiling an intensity of smoke and heat as it goes. Cradled in oak, it flattens on the midpalate before rising in strength and length on the finish.\n",
       "12324    Comes across a bit baked, syrupy and sweet on the nose, with a hint of stalkiness and stem. The palate has a lush early feel, but further inspection unveils a hollow core. Flavors veer toward earthy raspberry, while the finish is chunky and prope...\n",

       "20370    Once coaxed out of the glass, there is something ethereal about this Pinot Noir in its compelling, lifted nose of elderberry, wild raspberry and aromatic nettle. It is deceptively light on the surface with translucent veils of silky tannins that ...\n",
       "21156    Savory whiffs of nut skins, earth and sweat juxtapose sweet grapefruit and peach in this slightly rustic Riesling. Delicately textured with a lacy veil of sweetness, it's balanced briskly by a core of lime acidity. The finish is long and meandering.\n",
       "23966    This is Ferreira's top vineyard that also produces the legendary Barca Velha in the best years. This rich, spicy, solid wine has excellent structure, ripe tannins and juicy black fruits. Even more, it has a sense of restrained power, the dark tex...\n",
       "27615    The ripe berry flavors wear a veil of deeply toasted oak in this smooth and supple wine, but does it with finesse. Flavorful, smooth and not weighty, it has a pleasing, even texture on the tongue and displays good persistence with berry, pepper a...\n",
       "29122    A light mauve in color, this Pinot Noir-based wine shows boisterous plum fruit, macerated strawberries and a hint of clove on the ripe nose, making it more entrée-ready than apéritif-aimed. The palate offers strawberry and bubble-gum notes deftly...\n",
       "29701    Pretty white blossom and fresh apple notes are cast in a veil of crushed minerals in this deft, delicate Riesling. Lacy sweetness and sunny tangerine acidity brighten the midpalate. This is a lovely off-dry wine that's delicious now for it's fres...\n",
       "29927                  Dark in color, this hearty, full-bodied red unveils aromas of vanilla and marshmallow in a rich, concentrated opening that veers confectionary. Grippy tannin and leather provide a grit to the texture amid tart black cherry and tobacco.\n",
       "29996                     A waxy vein of petroleum cuts enticingly through juicy-sweet pink grapefruit and peach flavors in this dainty semisweet Riesling. It's vivaciously spry yet finishes long on a lingering lacy veil of sweetness. Drink now through 2022.\n",
       "30591    Rounded, plump little apricots are suggested in this clean-cut but ripe and dry Riesling with its straight, mineral backbone and impressive balance. A deep and rich core of fruit will unveil layers of fruit and complexity over years to come. Drin...\n",
       "30952                                             A blend of 55% Chenin Blanc and 45% Viognier, with the Chenin strongly represented. This wine unveils caramel popcorn and oak-influenced pear-vanilla, its layers of texture workable with a wide range of food.\n",

       "40187       Dark and dusty, this palate-coating wine shows well-managed tannins, smoothed just enough to unveil the strawberry, cherry and cassis fruit flavors. A mix of French and American (Wisconsin!) barrels brings toast and a wash of brine to the finish.\n",
       "41768    From the famed vineyard named for the colorful author, this wine remains a standout for the producer, and a tremendous deal for the quality. It exudes notes of eucalyptus on the nose, before unveiling big-boned but balanced tannins, with leather ...\n",
       "42967            There's a very attractive ashen quality to this wine that sits like a veil over a base of stone fruit, honey and pear. The mineral notes come from Campania's rich volcanic soils and this Falanghina does a great job of portraying the variety.\n",
